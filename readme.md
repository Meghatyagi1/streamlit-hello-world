# Chatbot Development with Python and Streamlit

## Project Overview
This project explores the development of chatbots using Python, Streamlit, and LLMs (Large Language Models). The goal is to build a chatbot with memory, integrated functions, and an engaging UI, while leveraging best practices in prompt engineering, vector databases, and document summarization.

## Features
1. Python Development Environments: Comparison of GitHub Codespaces and PyCharm for Streamlit development.
2. Web-based Application Deployment: Guide to creating and deploying a Streamlit app with a public URL.
3. Simple Chatbot: Build a basic chatbot using Streamlit with chat history functionality.
4. LLM Integration: Implement a chatbot with short-term memory using OpenAI.
5. Enhanced UI: Create a chatbot with a user-friendly interface and real-time responses.
6. Prompt Engineering: Experiment with tone, detail, and system prompts to fine-tune chatbot responses.
7. Knowledge Q&A Bot: Use vector databases to build a bot that answers questions about iSchool graduate courses.
8. Function Integration: Research LLM functions and implement a custom function within the chatbot.
9. Document Summarization Agent: Build an agent that summarizes documents based on user input.
10. Advanced Exploration: Investigate long-term memory, Langchain, or other advanced chatbot topics.

## Getting Started
1. Set up the development environment using either GitHub Codespaces or PyCharm.
2. Follow the documentation to deploy a simple "Hello World" Streamlit app.
3. Build and iterate on chatbot functionalities by following the task sequence.

## Documentation
Each task is thoroughly documented, outlining key challenges, best practices, and solutions encountered during development.

## Future Work
Explore advanced chatbot capabilities like long-term memory or integrate additional LLM-based functions for enhanced interactivity.
